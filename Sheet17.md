Structured thinking and clear communication: You quickly gather information about new situations from multiple perspectives, synthesize what you learn, and use frameworks / expertise / best practices to develop innovative solutions. More importantly, you can package information in ways that inform and influence stakeholders, communicating clearly and with confidence. Everyone from developers to analysts to project managers and executives needs to understand how Amitech can solve healthcare challenges and create value for their organizations, so you need to be able to communicate to different audiences in ways that connect with each of them differently.

You must be able to balance asking the right questions with providing direction to ensure that initiatives are successfully implemented. You can convince people of both the “why” and the “how” of delivering successful projects.



Embracing ambiguity and bringing order: This role is often responsible for finding the order and patterns in things that aren’t well defined, and building frameworks (process, technical, and otherwise) that get everyone working together toward common goals. You should be comfortable taking nebulous direction, translating it into a plan, and enlisting those you need to get the job done. You need to bring ideas and direction, but eagerly embrace feedback and integrate that into the final product.


Kind, humble, helpful and fun: We want you to be a person we enjoy collaborating with, spending time with, and investing in. You may be this person if you already invest heavily in those you work with, and if you consistently receive the feedback that you are a great colleague and teammate.
